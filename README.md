# Image Processing Solution for Aadhar and Smart Card Verification

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an image processing web application that automates the capture and verification of Aadhar and smart card details. It ensures accurate identification of genuine borrowers for government loan waivers, eliminating clerical errors and reducing time constraints.

---

## Objectives

1. **Automated Document Capture**: Seamlessly capture Aadhar and smart card details via web or mobile interfaces.
2. **OCR Processing**: Extract and verify text from uploaded documents.
3. **Fraud Detection**: Identify and flag forged documents.
4. **Data Validation**: Cross-check extracted data with government APIs.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide an intuitive and accessible interface for end users.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend**
- **React.js**: Build a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **React Router**: Manage navigation across the web application.
- **Material-UI**: Pre-built components for consistent UI/UX design.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**: Develop a scalable server-side application.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and document data.
- **Tesseract OCR**: Open-source library for text extraction.
- **AWS Textract**: Cloud-based OCR solution for enhanced accuracy.

### **Security**
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication and authorization.
- **JWT**: Token-based user session management.
- **AES Encryption**: Protect sensitive user data.

### **Deployment**
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- **AWS/GCP**: Cloud hosting for scalability and reliability.

## System Architecture

The system architecture is divided into three main layers:

### **1. Presentation Layer**
- User-facing interface built with React.js.
- Components for login, document upload, and verification result display.

### **2. Application Layer**
- REST API for handling requests between the frontend and backend.
- Middleware for authentication, file uploads, and data validation.

### **3. Data Layer**
- MongoDB for storing user details, uploaded documents, and verification logs.
- Integration with government APIs for Aadhar data validation.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Secure login using OAuth 2.0 and JWT.
   - Role-based access control for admins and users.

2. **Document Upload**:
   - Supports multiple file formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF).
   - Real-time image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy.

3. **Data Extraction**:
   - OCR technology extracts text from Aadhar and smart cards.
   - Data mapped to structured fields for validation.

4. **Verification**:
   - Cross-check extracted data with government databases via APIs.
   - Identify discrepancies or potential fraud.

5. **Results Dashboard**:
   - Display verification status, extracted data, and logs.
